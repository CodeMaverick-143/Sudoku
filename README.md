1. **Puzzle Generation**: A backtracking algorithm generates a valid Sudoku grid.
2. **Puzzle Masking**: Numbers are removed from the grid to create a playable puzzle. The number of removed cells determines the difficulty.
3. **User Input Handling**: Players can input their numbers into the grid, with real-time validation.
4. **Solution Validation**: Compares the userâ€™s inputs to the original solved grid.
5. **Solution Reveal**: The complete solution is displayed when the **Solve** button is clicked.
